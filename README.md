# GRAVITAS
#### A simple physics module for python

*The current goal of the project is to have basic physics simulations available at your fingertips. Physics caluclations with the help of one function.*

#### Usage
* Run Simulation for Particle System:
   * within **[engine2.py]()**
      inorder 

	*
   ```python
   # main.py
	import engine2 as e2d

   e2d.RunSimulation()
	```

#### Features
v 0.0.2 :

   1. *Rigid Body simulations (2D) [basic simulation under gravity infulence]*

v 0.0.1 :

   1. *Partilce Simulation (2D) [basic simulation under gravity under gravity influence]*
   
#### Roadmap
v 0.0.3 + :
   1. Collision detection for Solid Objects
   2. Constrained Rigid Body Simulation

## Instructions

1. Install
