# GRAVITAS
#### A simple physics module for python

*The current goal of the project is to have basic physics simulations available at your fingertips. Physics caluclations with the help of one function.*

#### Features
v 0.0.2 :

   1. *Rigid Body simulations (2D) [basic simulation under gravity infulence]*

v 0.0.1 :

   1. *Partilce Simulation (2D) [basic simulation under gravity under gravity influence]*
   
#### Roadmap
v 0.0.3 + :
   1. Collision detection for Solid Objects
   2. Constrained Rigid Body Simulation

## Instructions

1. Install 

	*! pip package unavailable for the time being.*
