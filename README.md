# GRAVITAS
#### A simple physics module for python

*The current goal of the project is to have basic physics simulations available at your fingertips. Physics caluclations with the help of one function.*

#### Features
v 0.0.2 :

   1. *Charges*

v 0.0.1 :

   1. *Basic Newtons Gravitation Laws*
   2. *Oribtal Velocity* (tentitive)
   3. *Simple Gravitation simulations*

#### Project Map
v 0.0.3 - 0.0.4

   1. *Atomic Interaction*
   2. *Charge densities (and gauss law applications)*

v 0.0.5

   1. *Vector and Scalar quantities definitions for more accuracy*

v 0.0.6

   1. 3*D physics. Only based on points and its location in space.*
